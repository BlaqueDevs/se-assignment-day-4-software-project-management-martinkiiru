## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is an iterative, flexible approach where development happens in cycles (sprints), allowing continuous feedback and adaptability to change. It’s best suited for dynamic projects with evolving requirements. However, it requires experienced teams and can be unpredictable in cost and timeline.

Waterfall follows a structured, sequential process with well-defined phases (Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment). It works well for projects with fixed requirements but lacks flexibility, making changes difficult once development starts.

🔹 Agile is ideal for fast-paced, evolving projects like software development and startups.
🔹 Waterfall is best for well-defined, stable projects such as government contracts or manufacturing.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is More Beneficial For:
Agile works best for projects that are dynamic, require frequent updates, and involve continuous customer collaboration.

🔹 Examples of Agile Projects:

Software Development (Apps & Websites) – Example: A startup developing a mobile app with evolving user needs.
AI & Machine Learning Projects – Example: Training an AI model where algorithms need frequent tuning based on test results.
E-Commerce Platforms – Example: An online marketplace adding new features based on customer feedback.
Game Development – Example: A gaming company launching early access versions and updating based on player feedback.
Financial Tech (FinTech) Products – Example: A payment gateway that needs constant security and compliance updates.
📌 Waterfall is More Beneficial For:
Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, strict regulatory guidelines, or when predictability is essential.

🔹 Examples of Waterfall Projects:

Government & Defense Contracts – Example: Developing a national ID system where requirements are fixed.
Healthcare Systems & Medical Devices – Example: A hospital management system that must meet strict regulatory approvals.
Infrastructure & Construction – Example: Building a bridge where each phase must be completed before moving forward.
Manufacturing & Hardware Development – Example: Designing a new aircraft where changes are costly after production starts.
Banking Software with Fixed Regulations – Example: A compliance-focused system for a bank that cannot afford frequent changes.
